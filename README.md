## api-ecom

Simple, basic API I created for my frontend project which you can find by [clicking here.](https://github.com/lukaasz555/ecom)

This API allows user to add/modify/delete products and view orders, so nothing fancy:)

It's my first project with node/express and I'm aware that many things could be done better so I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions.

Feel free to send me an email at [hello@lzegar.pl](mailto:hello@lzegar.pl)
